        <h1>ABOUT LOOKSM</h1>

        <p>
          "Lookism" is a popular South Korean webtoon (manhwa) written and
          illustrated by Park Tae-jun. It explores themes of appearance,
          identity, and social hierarchy, primarily focusing on how societal
          perceptions of physical attractiveness influence people's lives.
        </p>

        <h3>SYSPNOSIS</h3>
        <p>
          "Lookism" follows the life of a high school student named Park
          Hyung-suk (also known as Daniel Park in some translations). Hyung-suk
          is overweight, unattractive, and frequently bullied by his peers
          because of his appearance. His life takes a dramatic turn when he
          mysteriously gains the ability to switch between two bodies: his
          original, overweight body and a new, handsome and physically fit body.
        </p>

        <h3>THEMES</h3>
        <p>
          Duality of Appearance: Hyung-suk's experience with two different
          bodies allows him to see firsthand the stark contrast in how people
          treat him based on his looks. In his handsome body, he is treated with
          respect and admiration, while in his original body, he faces prejudice
          and bullying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bullying and Social Issues: The manhwa addresses the serious issue of
          bullying in schools and how it affects victims. It also explores other
          social issues like discrimination, self-esteem, and the pressure to
          conform to societal beauty standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal Growth: Throughout the story, Hyung-suk learns valuable
          lessons about self-worth, empathy, and the importance of inner beauty.
          His experiences in both bodies help him grow as a person and
          understand the superficiality of judging others based on appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complex Characters: "Lookism" features a wide range of characters,
          each with their own backstories and struggles. These characters
          include friends, enemies, and love interests, all contributing to the
          rich narrative and Hyung-suk's journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humor and Satire: The manhwa balances its serious themes with humor
          and satire, often poking fun at societal norms and the absurdity of
          judging people solely based on looks.
        </p>
